To use these scripts:

1. Login to your Qualtrics acoount and open a survey in the survey editor.

2. Select or add a question and click on the "Advanced Question Options" button 
(the gear icon below the question name). Click on "Add JavaScript..."

3. A new window will pop up. Delete the contents of this window, 
then copy+paste one of the entire script from the six JavaScript files.


Remember that the scripts will function properly only if the required input 
variables are defined in the Survey Flow (as embedded data) before the script.
Some scripts also refer to HTML DOM elements. You have to add these elements to
the current question, otherwise, the scripts will not run properly.
